#summary How to run AoF completely from an SD card
= Introduction =

With AoF on SD card it is *not* necessary to flash anything to NAND of your Freerunner, not even another bootloader. The Howto here assumes you have an SD card layout where your first (primary) partition is FAT32 and your second is ext2/3. For other setups have a closer look at the patches to modify them according to your needs. Anything beyond the 2nd partition does not matter. See also [#SD_partition_layout SD partition layout] part of this page.

Before continuing, make sure to understand the general principles explained in [ImproveIt Improve it] and [BuildIt Build it].

The modifications and instructions below are different for Cupcake and Froyo. Please skip to the section relevant for you branch (Cupcake or Froyo).

== Cupcake ==

Do the following steps in a directory where you want to build Cupcake. All prerequisites should be set up.

 # get a copy of Cupcake repo (if not already on your system)
 # get the patches from here [http://code.google.com/p/android-on-freerunner/issues/detail?id=7&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Owner%20Summary%20BuildVersion%20AndroidVersion%20Component#c70 issue 7 comment 70]
 # apply the patch
   {{{
   $ patch -p1 < cupcake.patch
   }}}
 # build Cupcake
 # copy the necessary directories and files onto the 2nd partition (ext2/3) of your SD card using [#Copy_to_/_Update_your_SD_installation this script].

== Froyo ==

Do the following steps in a directory where you want to build Froyo. All prerequisites should be set up.

 # get a copy of Froyo repo (if not already on your system)
 # get the patches from here 
 # get the patches from here [http://code.google.com/p/android-on-freerunner/issues/detail?id=7&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Owner%20Summary%20BuildVersion%20AndroidVersion%20Component#c70 issue 7 comment 70]
 # apply the patch
   {{{
   $ patch -p1 < froyo.patch
   }}}
 # build Froyo
 # copy the necessary directories and files onto the 2nd partition (ext2/3) of your SD card using the [#Copy_to_/_Update_your_SD_installation copy script].
 # Boot Froyo once and replug the SD card into your PC again and modify the Froyo settings to increase responsiveness. See the FAQ section for detailed instructions.

=== Scripts ===

== Copy to / Update your SD installation ==

Make sure you have the correct permissions to do the following and you have `rsync` installed.

{{{
#!/bin/bash

#replace by the directory where your build is
FROM="/mnt/android-dev/aof/out/target/product/freerunner"
#replace by mountpoint of SD card
TO="/media/android"
RSYNCOPTS=" -aP "

rsync $RSYNCOPTS $FROM/root/ $TO/
rsync $RSYNCOPTS $FROM/system/ $TO/system/
test -d "$TO/boot" || mkdir $TO/boot
rsync $RSYNCOPTS $FROM/kernel.img  $TO/boot/uImage-GTA02.bin
cp -v $TO/init $TO/sbin/init
chmod --changes -R 777 $TO
}}}

== Modify Froyo settings ==

Make sure you have the correct permissions to do the following and you have `sqlite3` installed.

 * mount android SD card and navigate to settings directory
   {{{
   $ pmount android
   $ cd /media/android/data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases/
   }}}
 * modify database
   {{{
   $ echo "REPLACE INTO \"system\" VALUES(26,'window_animation_scale','0.0'); \
     REPLACE INTO \"system\" VALUES(27,'transition_animation_scale','0.0');" | sqlite3 settings.db
   }}}

== SD partition layout ==

Use your favourite partitioning tool to create/modify the partitions on your SD card to have one FAT32 partition at the beginning, followed by one ext2/3 partition for the AoF system. Example layout:

|| partition number || mmcblk0p1    || mmcblk0p2 || mmcblk0p3 || mmcblk0p5 ||
|| filesystem       || vfat         || ext3      || ext3      || ext3      ||
|| used for         || AoF storage  || AoF system|| system X  || storage X ||

Note that for best SD usage mmcblk0p1 should be used for a third system and "AoF storage" placed in a logical partition. See [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Qi#Boot_Order Qi boot order] to understand why. However, this has not yet been tested. Volunteers are welcome :)
