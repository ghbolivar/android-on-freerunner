== Installing Git & Repo ==

Installing Repo:
 {{{
 $ curl http://android.git.kernel.org/repo >~/bin/repo

 }}}

Based on Android main project [http://source.android.com/projects Link to Android Project page]

The projects are grouped in three main categories *with android-on-freerunner specific projects*:
 * Core projects:  These projects make up the foundation of the Android platform.
 * External projects:  The Android Open Source Project makes use of many other open source projects.
 * Packages:  These projects are standard Android applications and services. 

== Making your own repository ==

 Create an empty directory to hold your working files.
   {{{
   $ mkdir aof_source
   $ cd aof_source
   }}}
 Initialise repository, linking it to the cupcake branch where current development is focused. 
   {{{
   $ repo init -u git://gitorious.org/android-on-freerunner/freerunner_platform_manifest.git -b cupcake
   }}}

 Synchronise the repository. _This step may take awhile._
   {{{
   $ repo sync
   }}}

== Modifying ==
== Team Collaboration ==
