#summary android-on-freerunner, Set-up, use & support.

*Under Construction (10 Oct 09)*

== Post install set-up ==

How you set up and use your system is up to you, but here are a few pointers that might help you out the first time you load Android onto your Freerunner. _It might even help all the other times too!_

The initial screen is locked and tells you to `Press the Menu key` to unlock. Push the Power button on your Freerunner to unlock the screen.

Here is a short listing of the button options:
|| Menu || Power - short ||
|| Back || Aux - short ||
|| Suspend || Power = medium (~2 sec) ||
|| Home || Aux - medium ||
|| Shutdown || Power - long (> 3 sec) ||
|| Switch apps || Aux - long ||

The medium-length functions can be hard to control. An alternative way to invoke suspend is to hold Aux and then press Power. If you set home button behaviour to `Home, then sleep` under spare parts, this works to get the home screen also.

You do most configuration using the `Settings` menu.  Either pull up the bottom tab on the screen or give the Power button a short press and tap `Settings`

Some of the things you should do here are:
 * Under `Sound & display` scroll all the way down to `Screen timeout` and set the screen timeout to something more than the default 1 minute (at least while you are ~~playing about~~ getting to know Android on your phone).
 * While your there you might want to adjust the brightness to make reading all these menu options easier.
 * Now backup the menu (using the Aux button) and choose `Applications` then `Development`.  Under here you want to switch on `Stay awake` so that your screen stays visible while connected to your main system.
 * Also under `Development` you might want to activate the `Unknown sources` option as you will only be able to install non_Market applications!

Now that your phone isn't going to keep blanking out on you it's time to customize it to your liking. You will want to:
 * Choose your phones language under `Locale & text`
 * Set your timezone and time/date formats under `Date & time settings`
 * You may have to switch off `Automatic`.  This doesn't work with my provider and I need to set time and date manually.
