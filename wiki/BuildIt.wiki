#summary Build your own system and test out your changes.

== ARM Toolchain ==
The Freerunner uses an ARM processor. Chances are your host machine doesn't. That means if you you are going to build code designed to run on it you need to set up an environment that enables that on your host machine.

That's where things get complicated!  There are different ways to achieve a suitable build environment and there are lots of host machine operating systems and processors. 

= Setting up your system =
The information on how to configure your 32-bit or 64-bit x86 system or your Mac OS system can be found on the main Google Android project page [http://source.android.com/download here.] These set ups are based on running Java 5.

Karmic users can install sun-java5-jdk by adding the following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list:
    {{{
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper main restricted
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper universe multiverse
    }}}

Then run:
    {{{
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jdk
    }}}

In addition gcc-4.3, g++-4.3, liblzo2-dev and uboot-mkimage are needed:
    {{{
    # sudo aptitude install gcc-4.3 g++-4.3 liblzo2-dev uboot-mkimage 
    }}}

== Compiling ==
Install repo and download the source code following instructions on [http://code.google.com/p/android-on-freerunner/wiki/ImproveIt the wiki ImproveIt page.] Make sure to use the repo links for this project and not the standard ones mentioned on that page.

If sun-java5-jdk was installed using the procedure above then run:
    {{{
    $ export CC=gcc-4.3 
    $ export CXX=g++-4.3 
    $ make -j 4 TARGET_PRODUCT=fr
    }}}

Otherwise specify the JAVA folder:
    {{{
    $ export JAVA_HOME=<path-to-jdk1.5.0_22 >
    $ export ANDROID_JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME 
    $ export CC=gcc-4.3 
    $ export CXX=g++-4.3 
    $ make -j 4 TARGET_PRODUCT=fr
    }}}
